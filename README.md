# ASP.NET-student-portal
Student webpage with login, profile and posts

Students have the ability to login to the page, post textual messages and edit their profiles (password etc). There are also
admin users which's posts are of different color, they can delete user posts as well as create new web page accounts.

## NOTE:
I seem to have lost the DB for the page...
